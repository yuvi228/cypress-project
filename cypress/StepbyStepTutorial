Create one folder for project, here cypress-project
mkdir cypress-project

Open terminal and change to this directory - 
cd cypress-project

Initialize package.json (Required for Cypress)
npm init -y
This creates a package.json file, which tracks dependencies.

Install Cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev
This installs Cypress locally in node_modules/.

Open Cypress for the First Time
npx cypress open
This automatically creates the Cypress folder structure (cypress/) inside your project.

Folder Structure Created Automatically
After running Cypress for the first time, your project will have:
cypress-project/
│── node_modules/    
│── cypress/  
│   ├── downloads/   
│   ├── e2e/         # Cypress test files go here  
│   ├── fixtures/    # Stores mock data (JSON, images, etc.)  
│   ├── support/     # Custom commands and utilities  
│── cypress.config.js # Cypress config file  
│── package.json     
│── package-lock.json 

Create a Sample Test
Inside cypress/e2e/, create a test file:
firstTest.cy.js

Now, run it using:
npx cypress open
